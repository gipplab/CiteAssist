# Frontend for CiteAssist

CiteAssist Frontend is written in TypeScript using React, a popular library for building user interfaces. This frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to generate preprints with related papers and BibTeX annotations.

## Prerequisites

To use the CiteAssist, you must have Node version 16.13.0 or higher installed on your machine.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and navigate to the ``frontend`` directory. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To start the frontend in development mode, run the following command:
```
npm start
```

This will start a development server on port 3000 by default. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## Building the Website
To build the website for deployment, run the following command:
```
npm run build
```
This will create a production build of the website in the ``build`` directory. You can serve this directory using any web server.
